Castle Quest 2 related code.

Code related to the applications I've built to help keep track of anything I need within the Castle Quest 2 game. (http://www.castlequest.be/)


Reveals
=======
Users can submit reveals of players' lists within CQ2.

Potential targets can be found using the given filter or by browsing through all submitted reveals.


Curses
======
Users can submit curses placed on other players. An image will be created to keep track of the remaining times on curses.


Shards
======
Users can submit their shard lists here so that the IRC bot can pull that data on demand.
